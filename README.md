# Water-Quality
Introduction :

Water is one of the most crucial resources for most living creatures, including humans, and vital in sustaining life. We drink water every day to survive and so it is of utmost importance to ensure that the water we consume is potable or not. Most impurities have a certain limit till they are safe to consume, exceeding these limits will cause a threat to life and negatively impact it. Several methods are used to gauge the quality of water from rivers, lakes, and oceans.
There are also other different applications for which we need to gauge the quality of water - in the pharmaceutical industry, we need the utmost purity of water; for agriculture and industry, we need water that is not too salty, free of toxins that shouldn't damage the crops and soil and not damage the environment.
We will be using various Machine Learning algorithms to predict the water quality based on the parameters provided. The algorithms used in this project are: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM).
